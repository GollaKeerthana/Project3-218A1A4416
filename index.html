                <p>Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers,
                that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.<br>
                    Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry as consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices, or wherever they want. The B2C (business to consumer) 
                    process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to have it delivered relatively quickly.<br>
                    shopping is a common activity that people do for different reasons. Whether it’s in-store or online, shopping can be a fun and exciting experience. It’s a way for people to buy what they need or want, and sometimes, it’s just a way to have fun and relax.</p>

                Shopping constitutes a compulsory function for humans in all walks of life. For a majority of people, shopping is an activity that has transcended from being merely a necessity to one that has become a favorite pastime that brings happiness, recreation, and ‘quality time with friends and members of the family.
                Customers can get everything they require under one roof, thus eliminating the need to transport themselves from one point to another. This saves on fuel and other charges that emanate from physical movement of people for shopping.
